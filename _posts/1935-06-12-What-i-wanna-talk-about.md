In my every loving determination to finally make posts, I have compiled a list.\
This is everything I plan to write about in the near future, ranging from low-level C memory management to general developer.

Here is the plan:

- [ ] **Stack Alloc implementation**
- [ ] **Stack DSA and macro dispatching**
- [ ] **Compilers are smart**
  - Auto bit-shifting, loop unrolling, etc.
- [x] **Why you should learn C**
- [ ] **Not becoming insane using C (Custom Strings)**
- Arena overview
  - Dynamic arrays
  - C-strings vs Custom Strings
- [ ] **Stupid ass optimisation in C**
- [ ] **Use Git u git**
- [ ] **Get used to the Command Line**
  - There is only so much abstraction can do for you
- [ ] Bit masks and low level usages
- [ ] **"Reinventing the wheel is a waste of time"**
  - No it's not.
  - Not everything ever made fits every use case.
  - That's why new things get made.
  - It is the best way to learn.
- [ ] **Learning multiple languages**
- [ ] **Learning multiple graphics APIs**
