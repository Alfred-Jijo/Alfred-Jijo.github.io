## Description
Project Hyperion is an automated sky monitoring and control system prototype using Raspberry Pi cameras. It captures sky images at configurable intervals, transmits data to a remote server, and aims to evolve into a scalable robotic telescope system integrating advanced data analytics and autonomous control. The project is designed to grow through iterative phases, incorporating power optimization, weather data integration, and machine learning for sky condition analysis. 

**Hyperion** symbolizes the quest to **steal insight from heavenly light.**

## Usage
- Configure capture intervals and camera settings via the provided front-end interface.
- Images are captured and uploaded automatically to the remote server.
- Access captured images and generated timelapses through the interface.
- Use the bundled Python scripts to compute astronomical coordinates of images.

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: Prototype with Raspberry Pi camera system capturing configurable interval images.
- Phase 2: Power optimization/off-grid operation.
- Phase 3: Integration of HOBO weather station data for enhanced sky condition analysis.
- Phase 4: Machine learning model development for sky classification and anomaly detection.
- Phase 5: Transition to a fully autonomous robotic telescope system.
